## Assumptions and imperatives

### Assumptions
- __Conscious Community__
-- Way Calm assumes a community of conscious things. This assumption depends on numerous other assumptions, mostly enumerated in this list, but assuredly some that are not contemplated by this dogma. However, the assumption of belonging to a community of conscious things is fundamental and declarative: all dogma and doctrine must support this belief to be part of Way Calm.
- __Things__
-- Things are discrete entities exhibiting behaviors. Things that coordinate their behavior with other things can together comprise new, emergent things. The more levels of coordination, the greater the variability each behavior exhibits, such that the simplest things behave reliably with irresistible effects on things that emerge from their coordinated behavior. The behaviors of things comprise reality.
- __Behaviors__
-- Behaviors are what things do: enabling, causing, perceiving, or resisting change among other things. A thing has at least one behavior: being, the simplest behavior of a thing, but one almost always comprising a set of simpler behaviors.
- __Reality__
-- Reality is formless yet constrained: a roiling, indeterminate emanation of limited possibilities. Itself not a thing, reality is a summary evocation of the ongoing behavior of all things. It thereby serves best as a characteristic of things, an indication that a thing behaves in a way that changes the behaviors of other things.
- __Experiences__
-- Experiences are discrete sequences of being conscious, inherently subjective but usually amenable to description/communication. Any thing that can be conscious can have experiences.    
- __Measures__
-- Measures are ways to create more objective references to things and behaviors, enabling coordinated and iterative behaviors for things that use measures. A measure contains one or more unambiguous dimensions/values, but most contain at least two.

### Imperatives
- __Parsimony__
-- Keep it simple. Don't describe things or behaviors you can't measure.
- __Bias__
-- Subjective individuality entails biases of various degrees and sources. Evaluate biases on an ongoing, periodic basis and adjust affected behaviors to mitigate the impact of your biases on making reasoned choices.
- __Equity__
-- Be fair. Assumptions, imperatives, methods, and precedents must apply/occur equitably: though some dogma and doctrine may apply only to specific kinds of behavior, all things are bound by, qualified for, and representative of them if they exhibit the behavior.




## Being  
- Being is a behavior, required by all other behaviors. While being, a thing exhibits all its intrinsic qualities.
-- Sensing is a behavior comprising the detection of other things' behaviors through ongoing biological measures.
-- Being conscious is the ongoing integration of sensations into a unified subjective perspective.
