## Guidelines for calming a stressed world
Way Calm is a practice for __making reasoned choices__ that __promote calm__. It includes dogma (assumptions and imperatives) and doctrine (methods and precedents), which elaborate on one imperative: Behave yourself.

### Assumptions
- __Conscious Community__
-- Way Calm assumes a community of conscious things. This assumption depends on numerous other assumptions, mostly enumerated in this list, but assuredly some that are not contemplated by this dogma. However, the assumption of belonging to a community of conscious things is fundamental and declarative: all dogma and doctrine must support this belief to be part of Way Calm.
- __Things__
-- Things are discrete entities exhibiting behaviors. Things that coordinate their behavior with other things can together comprise new, emergent things. The behavior of things produces reality.
- __Behaviors__
-- Behaviors are what things do: a thing enabling, causing or resisting change among other things. A thing must have at least one behavior: being, the simplest behavior of a thing, but almost always comprising a set of simpler behaviors.
- __Reality__
-- Reality is formless yet constrained: a roiling, infinite mass of limited possibilities. Reality is itself not a thing - it is a summary evocation of the ongoing behavior of all things. It thereby serves best as a label of things, an indication that a hypothetical thing does exist - that it behaves, and thereby changes the behaviors of other things.
- __Experiences__
-- Experiences are discrete portions of the subjective perception of being.    
- __Measures__
-- Measures are ways to create more objective references to things and behaviors, enabling coordinated and iterative behaviors for things that use measures. A measure contains one or more unambiguous dimensions/values, but most contain at least two.

### Imperatives
- __Parsimony__
-- Keep it simple. Don't describe things or behaviors you can't measure.
- __Bias__
-- Subjective individuality entails biases of various degrees and sources. Evaluate biases on an ongoing, periodic basis and adjust affected behaviors to mitigate the impact of your biases on making reasoned choices.
- __Equity__
-- Be fair. Assumptions, imperatives, methods, and precedents must apply/occur equitably: though some dogma and doctrine may apply only to specific kinds of behavior, all things are bound by, qualified for, and representative of them if they exhibit the behavior.




## Being  
- Being is a behavior, required by all other behaviors. While being, a thing exhibits all its intrinsic qualities
-- Sensing=Translating sensor readings into consciousness
-- Being conscious is pseudovoluntary, meaning it happens automatically but can be directed by the behaver. It entails integrating sensory inputs into persistent patterns
Reality is the perception, not the thing itself
