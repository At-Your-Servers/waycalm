## Guidelines for calming a stressed world
Way Calm is a practice for making reasoned choices that promote calm. It includes dogma (assumptions and imperatives) and doctrine (methods), which elaborate on one imperative: Behave yourself.

### Principles
- __Bias__
-- Subjective individuality entails biases of various degrees and sources. Enumerating biases on an ongoing, periodic basis and then refactoring affected ideas is required for way calm.
- __Equity__
-- Assumptions, imperatives, and methods are equitable: though some dogma and doctrine may apply only to specific kinds of behavior, all things are bound by and due them if they exhibit the behavior.
- __Parsimony__
-- When describing, keep it simple. Don't describe things or behaviors you can't measure.
- __Behaviors__
-- Behaviors are what things do: a thing causing or resisting change among other things. Any thing must have at least one behavior.

- __Things__
-- Things are that which can behave. A thing can comprise any number of other, coordinated things. The behavior of things produce reality.

- __Measures__
-- Measures are the means of standardizing references to things and behaviors. They contain one or more dimensions/values.





## Being  
- Being is a behavior, required by all other behaviors. While being, a thing exhibits all its intrinsic qualities
-- Sensing=Translating sensor readings into consciousness
-- Being conscious is pseudovoluntary, meaning it happens automatically but can be directed by the behaver. It entails integrating sensory inputs into persistent patterns
Reality is the perception, not the thing itself
