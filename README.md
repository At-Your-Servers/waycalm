## Guidelines for calming a stressed world
Way Calm is a practice for making reasoned choices that promote calm. It includes dogma (assumptions and imperatives) and doctrine (methods), which elaborate on one imperative: Behave yourself.

### Principles
- __Behaviors__
-- Behaviors are the currency of reality: a thing's behavior collectively comprise its reality to other things. Behaviors can aggregate into larger-scale behaviors.

- __Things__
-- Things are the components of reality. A thing can comprise any number of other, coordinated things. A thing can behave - the behavior of things produce reality.

- __Measures__
-- Measures are the means of standardizing references to things and behaviors. They contain one or more dimensions/values.

- __Equity__
-- Assumptions, imperatives, and methods are equitable: though some dogma and doctrine may apply only to specific kinds of behavior, all things are bound by and due them if they exhibit the behavior.

- __Parsimony__
-- When describing, keep it simple. Don't describe things or behaviors you can't measure.




## Being  
- Being is a behavior, required by all other behaviors. While being, a thing exhibits all its intrinsic qualities
-- Sensing=Translating sensor readings into consciousness
-- Being conscious is pseudovoluntary, meaning it happens automatically but can be directed by the behaver. It entails integrating sensory inputs into persistent patterns 
Reality is the perception, not the thing itself
